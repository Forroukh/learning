<!-- challenges of HRM -->
<div>
  <h2>Challenges of HRM</h2>
  <p>Due to the fluctuating economy as well as local and global advancements, there are many changes occurring rapidly that affect HR in a wide range of issues.</p>
  <h3>Taking a Closer Look at the Top 3 Human Resource Management Challenges</h3>
  <ol>

    <li>
      <h3>Change Management</h3>
      <p>Since this is generally not a focal point for HR professional training and development, change management represents a particular challenge for personnel management. The WFPMA finds that “This may also be the reason why it is cited as the foremost issue as HR continues to attempt to help businesses move forward. An intensified focus on training may be needed to develop added competencies to deal with change management.”</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Leadership Development</h3>
      <p>As the second of the biggest challenges for human resource management, leadership development needs to be a critical strategic initiative. HR professionals are faced with being expected to provide the essential structures, processes, tools, and points of view to make the best selection and develop the future leaders of the organization.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>HR Effectiveness Measurement</h3>
      <p>How can improvement happen without the right tools to measure HR effectiveness? As with many other areas of business, this profession also needs to be able to measure results in terms of transaction management, as well as in terms of the positive influence on business. “Utilizing metrics to determine effectiveness is the beginning of a shift from perceiving HR’s role as purely an administrative function to viewing the HR team as a true strategic partner within the organization.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>This world federation also notes that, <i>“Where HR departments have traditionally focused on measuring their own effectiveness, there is an evolving recognition that they can provide organizational value by measuring the effectiveness of the entire business organization. The shift is significant as it represents movement from simply counting the numbers hired to determining the ROI of collective and individual hires on a long-term basis. Going beyond measuring turnover, this new approach considers ‘bad’ turnover and ‘good’ turnover along with the overall cost of replacement hires.”</i></p>

</div>
<!-- organizational factors of hrm -->
<div>
  <h2>Organizational Factors of HRM</h2>
  <p>Human Resource Management is the most significant aspect of any enterprise because it involves effective management of the employees in the organisation. Employees are the biggest assets of any organisation, which makes Human Resource Management a domain that needs to be highly effective in order to make the employees as well as the organisation strive towards success.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Implementation of Technology</h3>
      <p>Implementation of HR Technology is one of the biggest factors affecting human resource management in an organisation. This is because today you have advanced HR software platforms that are designed to automate every aspect of HR functions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>The Work Environment</h3>
      <p>It was until last year that the conventional office environment was the only thing people would imagine. However, Covid-19 pandemic changed it all for good and today we are slowly getting used to the current situation where most of us are working from home.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Availability of Good Talent</h3>
      <p>Are expert professionals readily available for hiring? Sometimes, that's not the case and a situation like this can be stressful for the human resource management department, because it becomes increasingly difficult to find the right resources for open positions in the organisation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Training and Development</h3>
      <p>Training and development programs for the employees can be a great way to boost employee engagement and at the same time, help the organisation find resources with the exact skillset required for different positions.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>That was about the key factors affecting the success of human resource management in organizations today. Do you have more factors that you want to see as a part of this list? Share your thoughts with us in the comments section below.</p>

<div>
  <h2>Organizational Performance Model</h2>
  <p>A Causal Model of Organizational Performance and Change, or the Burke & Litwin Model, suggests linkages that hypothesize how performance is affected by internal and external factors.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The causal model links what could be understood from practice to what is known from research and theory. The model not only discusses how different dimensions link with each other but also discusses how the external environment affects the different dimensions in an organization.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The model focuses on providing a guide for both organizational diagnoses and planned, managed organizational change, one that clearly shows cause-and-effect relationships.</p>
  <h5><b>Outline of the Model</b> </h5>
  <p>The model revolves around 12 organizational dimensions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>External environment</li>
    <li>Mission and strategy</li>
    <li>Leadership</li>
    <li>Organizational culture</li>
    <li>Structure</li>
    <li>Management practices</li>
    <li>Systems</li>
    <li>Work unit climate</li>
    <li>Task and individual skills</li>
    <li>Individual needs and values</li>
    <li>Motivation</li>
    <li>Individual and organizational performance</li>

        <div id="planning_id">
          <h2>HR Planning</h2>
          <p>Human resource planning (HRP) is the continuous process of systematic planning ahead to achieve optimum use of an organization's most valuable asset—quality employees. Human resources planning ensures the best fit between employees and jobs while avoiding manpower shortages or surpluses.</p>
          <p class="shadow-lg  border-3 rounded border border-primary">
            <i> <u><b> KEY TAKEAWAYS :</b> </u> <br>
              Human resource planning (HRP) is a strategy used by a company to maintain a steady stream of skilled employees while avoiding employee shortages or surpluses. <br>
              Having a good HRP strategy in place can mean productivity and profitability for a company. <br>
              <br>
              There are four general steps in the HRP process: identifying the current supply of employees, determining the future of the workforce, balancing between labor supply and demand, and developing plans that support the company's goals.</i>
          </p>
  </div>
  <!-- purpose of hr planning  -->
  <div>
    <h2>Human Resource Planning – Purpose</h2>
    <h6>HRP is essential to forecast human resource requirements accurately. Once we are sure about the numbers and the quality of personnel required, it becomes easy to strike a balance between demand and supply.</h6> <br>
    <h6>HR planning helps a firm to cope with changes in market conditions such as competition, technology, regulatory framework, etc. in an effective way. HRP makes it possible for a company to have a vast pool of qualified people for vacancies that are likely to arise now and also in future.</h6>
    <br>
    <p> <b>Some of the compelling reasons that favour HRP may be listed thus:</b> </p>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Work can be Carried Out Smoothly:</h3>
      <p>To carry on its work, each organisation needs personnel with the necessary qualifications, skills, knowledge, work experience and aptitude for work. These are provided through effective manpower planning.</p>
    </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Demand-Supply Imbalances could be Arrested:</h3>
        <p>Human resource planning is essential because of frequent labour turnover which is unavoidable and even beneficial because it arises from factors which are socially and economically sound such as voluntary quits, discharges, marriage, promotions; or factors such as seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in business which cause a constant ebb and flow in the workforce in many organisations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3> Easy to Cope with Changes in Technology:</h3>
        <p>The nature of the present workforce in relation to its changing needs also necessitates the recruitment of new labour. To meet the challenge of a new and changing technology and new techniques of production, existing employees need to be trained or new blood injected in an organisation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Possible to Cope with Sudden Changes such as Expansion, Diversification, etc.:</h3>
        <p>In order to meet the needs of expansion programmes human resource planning is unavoidable. It becomes necessary due to increase in the demand for goods and services with growing population, a rising standard of living — larger quantities of the same goods and services are required.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- process of hr planning  -->
  <div>
    <h2>Human Resource Planning – Steps Involved in Human Resource Planning Process</h2>
    <p>The purpose of effective human resource planning is to ensure that a certain desired number of persons with the correct skills will be available at some specified time in future. <br>
<b>The various steps involved in the human resource planning process can be logically divided into three:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li >
    <h3> Human Resource Demand Forecasting:</h3>
    <p>The process of human resource planning starts with the forecasting of human resource requirement because it is always important for the management to first identify clearly the number of people required in future and then the entire process starts.</p>
  
  <ol type="i">
    <li>
      <h3 >Long Range Forecasting:</h3>
    <p>Though it is difficult to forecast the exact number of people required for future, still those responsible for planning human resource require­ments must be aware of the number of basic factors which should be taken into consideration so that the forecasting can turn out to be accurate to a certain extent-</p>
   <p> <b> a. The Firm’s Long-Range Business Plans:</b> </p>
   <p>It is important to know the long-range business plans for the firm, for example, if a firm wants to go in for automation or wants to bring in more of computers and replace the manpower with technology, this factor needs to be taken into consideration for working out the future manpower requirements.</p>
   <p> <b> b. The Economic Conditions:</b> </p>
   <p>Movements from prosperity to reces­sion and back to prosperity pose considerable problems for the HR executives. Though economic predictions are considerably difficult to make with accuracy, some considerations must be given to the level of economic activity in planning for human resource requirements.</p>
   <p> <b> c. Technological Trends:</b> </p>
   <p>Advances in technology have definite ef­fects on the nature and mixture of jobs available. For example, advances in computer technology resulted in a decrease ill the number of book-keepers, and an increase in the number of com­puter programmers.</p>
  
    </li>
    <li>
<h3>Short Range Forecasting:</h3>
<p>Though long-range planning may appear to be a luxury to most firms, the HR executives does require some lead time to provide the man­power required by the firm in the short run-</p>
<p> <b>a. Production Schedules and Budgets:</b> </p>
<p>Specific sales forecast for the coming year must be translated into a work plan for the various parts of the enterprise</p>
<p> <b>b. Human Resource Objectives:</b> </p>
<p>The HR people should always be informed about such changes as soon as possible so that they should be able to make arrangements to adjust the manpower wherever required and ensure the termination of employees in a nice and congenial atmosphere.</p>
    </li>
    
  </ol>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Human Resource Supply Forecasting:</h3>
    <p>Though the available supply of human talent would appear to be easier to determine than projected needs, there are a number of complexities in this decision as well.</p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>
<h3>Current Inventory:</h3>
<p>Maintaining proper personnel records are essential to indicate the availability of talent in various jobs, units and divisions within the firm.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Productivity Levels:</h3>
        <p>Future projection of resource needs are often made on the basis of past experience. As technology improves the productivity levels of a workforce, the number of persons required per unit of output will decline.
        </p>
      </li>
      <h3>Turnover Rate:
      </h3>
      <p>The rate of turnover for the organisation is an important parameter affecting the human resource planning for future. The turnover takes into consideration separations, quits, discharges, retirement, death, replacements, etc. </p>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Initiating Human Resource Actions:</h3>
    <p>The matching of projected human resource needs with projected human resource available provides the basis for undertaking various actions to ensure that supply will be able to match with demand at the time specified.</p>
    <p>Such actions as the following can be undertaken:</p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>
        
        <h3>Hiring:</h3>
        <p>In case projected supply is short of projected demand; the addition of new personnel is a likely possibility</p>
      </li>

  <h2>Job Analysis in HRM </h2>
  <p><b>The important concepts of job analysis are: </b> </p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      <h3>Job:</h3>
      <p>In simple language, a job may be understood as a division of total work into packages/positions. According to Dale Yoder, “A job is a collection or aggregation of tasks, duties and responsibilities as a whole, is regarded as a regular assignment to individual employees and which is different from other assignments”.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Job Description:</h3>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Duties</li>
        <li>Responsibilities</li>
        <li>Most important contributions and outcomes needed from a position</li>
        <li>Required qualification of candidates, and</li>
        <li>Reporting relationship and co-workers of a particular job.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
     <h3> Position Description:</h3>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Recruiting and staffing;</li>
      <li>Organizational and space planning;</li>
      <li>Performance management and improvement systems;</li>
      <li>Organization development;</li>
      <li>Employee orientation, development, and training;</li>
      <li>Employee safety, welfare, wellness and health;</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Job Specification:</h3>
    <p>It is a standard of personnel and designates the qualities required for an acceptable performance. It is written record of the requirements sought in an individual worker for a given job. It refers to a summary of the personnel characteristics required for a job.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Job Design:</h3>

  </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Importance of Job Analysis</h2>
  <h5>Job analysis is so important to HR managers that it has been called the building block of everything that personnel does.</h5>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      <h3>Work Redesign:</h3>
      <p>Often an organization seeks to redesign work to make it more effi­cient or to improve quality. The redesign requires detailed information about the existing job(s). In addition, preparing the redesign is similar to analyzing a job that does not yet exist.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Human Resource Planning:</h3>
      <p>As planners analyze human resource needs and how to meet those needs, they must have accurate information about the levels of skill required in various jobs, so that they can tell what kinds of human resources will be needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Selection:</h3>
      <p>To identify the most qualified applicants for various positions, decision makers need to know what tasks the individuals must perform, as well as the neces­sary knowledge, skills, and abilities.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Training:</h3>
      <p>Almost every employee hired by an organization will require training. Any training program requires knowledge of the tasks performed in a job, so that the training is related to the necessary knowledge and skills.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Job Evaluation:</h3>
      <p>The process of job evaluation involves assessing the relative dollar value of each job to the organization in order to set up fair pay structures.</p>
    </li>
    <h5>Besides helping human resource professionals, job analysis helps supervisors and other managers carry out their duties. Data from job analysis can help managers iden­tify the types of work in their units, as well as provide information about the work flow process, so that managers can evaluate whether work is done in the most effi­cient way.</h5>

<div>
  <h2>The anatomy of a job description</h2>
  <h5>How can you increase your chances of finding the right fit? We discuss seven tips for writing a killer job description.</h5>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      <h3>Start with a job analysis</h3>
      <p class="shadow-lg  border-3 rounded border border-secondary"><b> Analyze the following areas:</b>  <br>

        a. Mental/physical tasks required (planning, managing, lifting/carrying, cleaning, computer work, etc.)br

        b. Methods/equipment/technology/software used to do the job <br>
        c. Why the job exists (Is it a new role or are you replacing someone?) <br>
        d. The qualifications (education, training, certifications, knowledge, skills, personality traits, etc.) <br>
        e. How the job supports other people in the company</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Include an accurate job title</h3>
      <p>It sounds simple enough but using a clear job title is one of the best ways to attract talent who have the skills, experience and qualifications you need. Avoid using “clever” titles like “Marketing Whiz” or “Rockstar Web Designer.” Be specific if the job requires a certain level of experience, training or certifications.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Summarize the job</h3>
      <p>The job summary is the next important element of your description. You want to outline the goals, duties, and responsibilities expected with this role. You also want to explain how this new hire will fit into the company and with existing team members.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Summarize requirements and responsibilities</h3>
      <p>You may have touched on some of this in the job summary, but this next section can go into more detail. You want to be accurate and detailed about the qualifications and experience needed.
       If the job requires a specific degree, skills, X years of experience or certain certifications/licenses, then state that clearly.</p>
    </li>

  <h2>Job Analysis in the Jobless World</h2>
  <p> <i>Job Analysis is one of the most important functions performed by an HR manager in an organization. It involves procedures for determining the duties and skill requirements of a job and the kind of person who should be hired for it</i> </p>
  <br>
  <h3>A Jobless World</h3> <br>
  <p>Joblessness is a dreaded scenario, not just for the political or governing class but also for people who are in the service sector. Over the last one decade, many countries both developed such as the US and the UK and the developing ones like India have witnessed growth without a similar growth in the number of jobs. One can attribute this to two main factors – increasing automation in jobs that are manual in nature and; the trend towards outsourcing and off-shoring.

    According to Thomas Frey of The Futurist Magazine, the increasing use of machines to replace human effort is likely to cause 2 billion jobs to vanish by the year 2030.
    
    “With technologies like driverless cars, robotic assembly lines, and teacherless schools on the horizon, the handwriting is on the wall…” says Frey who blames the complacency of the academic institutions and the myopia of the business leaders for the future jobless scenario that he has predicted.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Challenges of Automation, Outsourcing and Off-shoring to Job Analysis</h3> <br>
    <p>During the early years of industrial revolution, machines were viewed by workers are their biggest enemies because of their ability to perform tasks much quicker and at lower cost per unit. Those years witnessed numerous riots where workers stormed factories to destroy machines. However, as hoped by those workers, their actions did not lead to the business owners reverting back to the use of manual workers to perform tasks that were repetitive in nature. Instead, the use of machines opened newer and better opportunities for the workers as a result of which people in the West has been able to achieve high standard of living.</p>
