                <h3>What Is a Supply Chain?</h3>
                <p> A supply chain is a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product to the final buyer. This network includes different activities, people, entities, information, and resources. The supply chain also represents the steps it takes to get the product or service from its original state to the customer.</p>

                        <li>A supply chain is a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product or service.</li>
                        <li>The entities in the supply chain include producers, vendors, warehouses, transportation companies, distribution centers, and retailers.</li>
                        <li>Supply chain management results in lower costs and a faster production cycle.</li>

                <h2>A Short History of Supply Chain Management</h2>
                <p> <i>Supply chain management forms the backbone of most economies and successful multinational companies today. From humble beginnings to global standards, its relatively short history is summarized in this article.</i> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>The early stages</h3>
                        <p>From these ancient times up until the 18th century, all parts of a supply chain were kept mostly local due to the lack of larger transport options and the high cost of moving goods around the world. Once shipping capabilities expanded, the quantities of goods that could be transported along any part of the supply chain grew exponentially.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Seismic shifts</h3>
                        <p>In the late 1920s, the introduction of mass production along assembly lines laid the foundations for supply chain management. First successfully implemented by Ford, the idea of producing consistent products on a large scale with increased efficiency changed trade and supply chains irreversibly.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Technological advances</h3>
                        <p>The innovation of the personal computer in the 1980s was the catalyst for more new tech that impacted supply chain management immensely, such as spreadsheets, optimization models and algorithms that could predict logistics issues for a supply chain. These solved problems with planning, resource management and forecasting, as well as making oversight of the entire supply chain easier to visualize, save, and share.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>To the future! </h3>
                        <p>In future, we are likely to see technology dramatically alter how supply chain management works. The Internet of Things (IoT) will enable businesses to create and implement new systems while production occurs. This will force companies to consider the needs of future product life cycles alongside their distribution of existing products.</p>
